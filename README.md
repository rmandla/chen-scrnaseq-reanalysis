# Analysis of scrna-seq data with scanpy

To learn about single-cell sequencing, I am recalculating the analysis from this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679370/). 

After downloading fastq files, kallisto was used to align data and create the read matrix. Reads were then processed using scanpy. 

I closely followed these two tutorials in this analysis:
* [official scanpy tutorial](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html)
* [kallisto analysis tutorial](https://github.com/BUStools/getting_started/blob/master/getting_started.ipynb)
